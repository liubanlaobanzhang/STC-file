Setting goals is very important for everyone. Let me show you an experience about it.

I usually fail my English exam. I feel sad and even think I am a loser. In order to improve my English grades, my parents set me a goal. I think it is a good idea, so I try my best to achieve my goal. I am practicing more English, such as listening to the English tapes and reading the English books every day.

My goal is like a mountain that I have to climb. Can I succeed with my hard work? Of course I can!

It's good to learn at another man's feet

Good morning，everyone!It's my great honor to have a chance to make a speech here. Today we are going to talk about learning from mistakes. Let me share an experience with you. 

I followed the advice of this proverb in the title, and improved my English grades. When I was in Grade 7, I used to get bad grades. I felt a down. My parents noticed my change in attitude. They advised me to learn from the mistakes of others. I realized that I had not listened to the teacher during the class and had hardly ever done English homework, so I started to listen to the teacher carefully and finish my homework with high quality. With my hard work, I succeeded passing the next English exam. 

Through that experience, I realized that we should learn from the failures of others, and avoid making the same mistakes. It is truly a good way to save time and energy, and achieve our goals faster.  As we all know, "It's good to learn at another man's feet."
